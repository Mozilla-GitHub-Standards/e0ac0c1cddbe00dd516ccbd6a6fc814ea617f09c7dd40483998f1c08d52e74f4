relman-tools
============

Tools used by release management:

* auto-pd uses ftp_poller.py to scan the releases directory on ftp in order to grab the latest released version and update product-details and mozilla.com to reflect the newest release in download buttons on web properties

* email-scripts is where we store our nagging scripts

* merge-day-scripts is pretty self-explanatory

* tracking-efficacy is a WIP to populate a Google spreadsheet with data about releases in the hopes of automating the gathering of that information to compare release-over-release tracking & quality
